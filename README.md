# Uncommon HTML Bug: Broken Image from Non-Existent Source

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to broken images caused by referencing non-existent image sources.  The bug is subtle because it doesn't throw a JavaScript error, but results in a broken image icon being displayed.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.html` file shows how to fix it using proper error handling and resource management techniques.  This type of issue is often overlooked, especially in larger projects.
